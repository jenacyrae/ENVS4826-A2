### Introduction

Just when it seemed 2020 couldn't get worse, we were hit with the news in late May that giant "murder hornets" were invading North America and would soon be terrorizing our backyards. Although these Asian giant hornets, which are the largest species on Earth, do not pose as much of a dangerous threat to humans as popular media would lead you to believe, there are still severe implications to their invasion of North America. The most significant threat of the Asian giant hornet, scientific name *V. mandarinia*, is that it is a known predator of honeybees, which provide important ecosystem services such as pollination. Therefore, it is very important that we are able to explore and control the spread of *V. mandarinia*. A recent scientific paper by Zhu et al. aims to do just that, using scientific modelling to determine their possible niches and measure the potential extent of their dispersion into North America.

### Methods

In order to develop global models of the distribution
