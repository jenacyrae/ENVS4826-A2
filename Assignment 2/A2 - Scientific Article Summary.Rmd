## Introduction

Just when it seemed 2020 couldn't get worse, we were hit with the news in late May that giant "murder hornets" were invading North America and would soon be terrorizing our backyards. Although these Asian giant hornets, which are the largest species on Earth, do not pose as much of a dangerous threat to humans as popular media would lead you to believe, there are still severe implications to their invasion of North America which makes it very important to understand and control their spread. A scientific paper by Zhu et al. published on September 22 aims to do just that, using scientific modelling to determine their possible niches and measure the potential extent of their dispersion into North America.
